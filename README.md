# computation-py
Python implementation for [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/).

## Introduction
[Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/) is an awesome book about computation theory, which explains profound and complicated concepts by using short and concise Ruby code snippets.

I don't want to evangelize, but if you are curious about how a program functions, you must read this book. It's just like SICP's ruby version in a way, yet with much more fun.

## What does this repository cover?
I just implemented equivalent codes from chapter to chapter, those contents are:

1. Two kinds of interpreters for a simple language.

2. Generating Python code for this language instead of Ruby (Because Python's anonymous functions are quite more limited than Ruby, there are some hacks.)

3. Simulating automata such as DFA, NFA, PDA.  

4. Using automata to build a simple regular expression engine.

5. Simulating a Turing machine.

6. Stay tuned..

## What is your Python's version?
Python 3, because it's the future.
